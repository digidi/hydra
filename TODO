= Hydra TODO

* hydra:sync task that runs the SSH syncing for remote workers
* ensure same version is running remotely (gem directive)
* on a crash, bubble up error messages
* send workers a "boot" message with all the files that will be tested so that it
  can boot the environment before forking runners
* named configurations (i.e. 'local', 'remote', 'myconfig') so users can swap configs with an
  environment variable or with a hydra testtask option

== Reporting

Refactor reporting into an event listening system. Add in a default listener that messages:

* Files at start
* Progress status "50% (10/20 files)"
* Time report at the end
